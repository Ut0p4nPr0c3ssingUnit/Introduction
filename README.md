# Greetings Tech Budding Users/Budding Enthusiasts 👋👍

I hold a BSc (Hons) in Mathematics and an MSc in Artificial Intelligence. My academic background gives me a strong foundation in mathematical reasoning, statistical thinking, and the principled development of machine learning systems.

I am deeply curious about the real-world applications of AI, with particular interest in:
- Healthcare: improving diagnostics, predictive models for patient outcomes, and personalized treatment strategies.
- Finance: risk modeling, algorithmic decision-making, and robust ML for trading and fraud detection.
- Cybersecurity: anomaly detection, threat intelligence, and AI-driven defensive systems.
- Physics & Quantum Technologies: exploring how AI can accelerate research and practical implementations in quantum computing and sensing.

My approach blends rigorous quantitative methods with practical engineering: I enjoy turning mathematical insight into reproducible models and scalable solutions. I am especially excited by interdisciplinary projects where domain knowledge and AI techniques meet to solve high-impact problems.
